# Recycle with Stycle 
Motiation🌱:
The inspiration for Stycle came from a simple but important question:
"Where does our clothing go after we’re done with it?"

As students at UCI, we realized that while many of us wanted to donate or recycle our clothes, we didn’t always know how or where to do it. Thrifting is trendy, but sustainable action often feels inconvenient or confusing. There was a clear need for a platform that made sustainable choices more accessible, visible, and empowering.

Stycle was created to bridge that gap.

# TL;DR

Stycle is a React-based website designed to promote sustainable fashion and encourage clothing donations at UCI. The platform educates users on the impact of fast fashion, provides donation guidelines, and helps locate nearby donation bins like Goodwill’s on campus. Features include thrift store discovery, ways to repurpose clothes, and collaboration with local sustainability partners.

Millions of tons of clothing are thrown away each year—much of it wearable or recyclable. Students, in particular, often don’t know **where to donate**, **what can be donated**, or **why it matters**. And let’s be honest—fast fashion is tempting when you’re on a budget. But it’s not just about affordability. It’s about **awareness**, **accessibility**, and **action**.

That’s where **Stycle** comes in.
